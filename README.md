## Introduction

Understanding data structures, algorithms, and design patterns is essential for every programmer, as they form the backbone of efficient and scalable software solutions. This repository aims to provide clear explanations and practical implementations of these concepts in Java.

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

1. **Classes and Objects**: Implementation of data structures, algorithms, and other components through classes and objects to encapsulate data and behavior.
2. **Inheritance**: Utilizing inheritance to create hierarchies among data structures or algorithms, promoting code reusability and facilitating polymorphism.
3. **Polymorphism**: Leveraging polymorphism to provide multiple implementations of algorithms or variations of data structures, enabling dynamic method invocation.
4. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulating data within classes and providing controlled access through methods to maintain code integrity and data security.
5. **Abstraction**: Abstracting away implementation details to provide a clear interface for interacting with data structures and algorithms, promoting code maintainability and flexibility.
6. **Interfaces**: Defining interfaces to establish contracts for classes, allowing for multiple inheritance-like behavior and enabling loose coupling between components.
7. **Packages**: Organizing classes and interfaces into packages to facilitate modular design, namespace management, and code organization.
8. **Exception Handling**: Handling exceptions to gracefully recover from errors and failures, ensuring robustness and reliability of the software.
9. **Generics**: Using generics to create parameterized types, enabling type safety, code reusability, and reducing code duplication.
10. **Lambda Expressions**: Utilizing lambda expressions to represent anonymous functions, enabling functional programming paradigms and concise code syntax.
11. **Multi-Threading**: Implementing multi-threaded applications to achieve concurrency and parallelism, improving performance and responsiveness of the software.

## Creational Design Patterns

1. **Singleton**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is useful when a single instance of a class needs to coordinate actions across the system.
   - Example: Database connection manager.
   
2. **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. This promotes flexibility in choosing object creation based on specific conditions.
   - Example: Creating different types of shapes (Circle, Square, etc.) based on user input.
   
3. **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This is useful when the system needs to be independent of how objects are created or composed.
   - Example: GUI library that can create buttons, text fields, and labels for different operating systems (Windows, MacOS).
   
4. **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is useful for assembling complex objects step by step.
   - Example: Constructing complex documents like reports with multiple sections and formats.
   
5. **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as a prototype. This is beneficial when object creation is costly, and an initial set of objects can be cloned as needed.
   - Example: Cloning objects in a graphical application to avoid the cost of creating new objects from scratch.

## Data Structures

1. **Arrays**: Basic array operations and algorithms.
2. **Linked Lists**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists.
3. **Stacks**: Stack data structure with various operations.
4. **Queues**: Implementation of different types of queues.
5. **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, etc.
6. **Graphs**: Graph representations and traversal algorithms.
7. **Heaps**: Min and max heaps and their applications.
8. **Hash Tables**: Hash table implementation and collision resolution techniques.
9. **Java Collections Framework**: Overview and usage of Java's built-in data structures such as ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap, etc.

## Algorithms

1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Various sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, quicksort, etc.
2. **Searching Algorithms**: Binary search, linear search, etc.
3. **Graph Algorithms**: Depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.
4. **Dynamic Programming**: Examples of dynamic programming problems and solutions.
5. **Greedy Algorithms**: Greedy approach and related algorithms.
