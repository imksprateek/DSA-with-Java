    The lifecycle of a thread in Java consists of several states, which a thread can move through during its execution.

    1. New: A thread is in this state when it is created but not yet started.
    2. Runnable: After the start method is called, the thread becomes runnable. Itâ€™s ready to run and is waiting for CPU time.
    3. Running: The thread is in this state when it is executing.
    4. Blocked/Waiting: A thread is in this state when it is waiting for a resource or for another thread to perform an action.
    5. Terminated: A thread is in this state when it has finished executing.
